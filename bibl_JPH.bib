abstract = {The applications of pressure work, pressure-dilatation, and dilatation-dissipation (Sarkar, Zeman, and Wilcox) models to hypersonic boundary flows are investigated. The flat plate boundary layer flows of Mach number 5-11 and shock wave/ boundary layer interactions of compression corners are simulated numerically. For the flat plate boundary layer flows, original turbulence models overestimate the heat flux with Mach number high up to 10, and compressibility corrections applied to turbulence models lead to a decrease in friction coefficients and heating rates. The pressure work and pressure-dilatation models yield the better results. Among the three dilatation-dissipation models, Sarkar and Wilcox corrections present larger deviations from the experiment measurement, while Zeman correction can achieve acceptable results. For hypersonic compression corner flows, due to the evident increase of turbulence Mach number in separation zone, compressibility corrections make the separation areas larger, thus cannot improve the accuracy of calculated results. It is unreasonable that compressibility corrections take effect in separation zone. Density-corrected model by Catris and Aupoix is suitable for shock wave/boundary layer interaction flows which can improve the simulation accuracy of the peak heating and have a little influence on separation zone.},

@article{Liou1996,
abstract = {While enjoying demonstrated improvement in accuracy, efficiency, and robustness over existing schemes, the advection upstream splitting method (AUSM) has been found to have deficiencies in some cases. This paper describes recent progress toward improving the AUSM. We show that the improved scheme, termed AUSM+, features the following properties: (1) exact resolution of 1D contact and shock discontinuities, (2) positivity preserving of scalar quantity such as the density, (3) free of "carbuncle phenomenon," (4) free of oscillations at the slowly moving shock, (5) algorithmic simplicity, and (6) easy entension to treat other hyperbolic systems. In this paper, we lay out a general construction for the AUSM+ scheme and prove its heretofore unreported mathematical properties. Especially a CFL-like condition for positivity-preserving property is derived. This positivity-preserving proves to be tightly related to the capability of calculating strong rarefaction and near vacuum flows. Finally, results of numerical tests on many problems are given to confirm the capability and improvements on a variety of problems including those failed by other well-known schemes. {\textcopyright} 1996 Academic Press, Inc.},

@article{Volpiani2018,
abstract = {Direct numerical simulations are employed to investigate a shock wave impinging on a turbulent boundary layer at free-stream Mach number M=2.28 with different wall thermal conditions, including adiabatic, cooled, and heated, for a wide range of deflection angles. It is found that the thermal boundary condition at the wall has a large effect on the size of the interaction region and on the level of pressure fluctuations. The distribution of the Stanton number shows a good agreement with prior experimental studies and confirms the strong heat transfer and complex pattern within the interaction region. An effort was also made to describe the unsteady features of the flow by means of wall pressure and heat flux spectra. Numerical results indicate that the changes in the interaction length due to the wall thermal condition are mainly linked to the incoming boundary layer, which is in agreement with previous experimental studies.},

@article{Huang2019,
abstract = {In this study, the ability of standard one- or two-equation turbulence models to predict mean and turbulence profiles, the Reynolds stress, and the turbulent heat flux in hypersonic cold-wall boundary-layer applications is investigated. The turbulence models under investigation include the one-equation model of Spalart-Allmaras, the baseline k-$\omega$ model by Menter, as well as the shear-stress transport k-$\omega$ model by Menter. Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) simulations with the different turbulence models are conducted for a flat-plate, zero-pressure-gradient turbulent boundary layer with a nominal free-stream Mach number of 8 and wall-to-recovery temperature ratio of 0.48, and the RANS results are compared with those of direct numerical simulations (DNS) under similar conditions. The study shows that the selected eddy-viscosity turbulence models, in combination with a constant Prandtl number model for turbulent heat flux, give good predictions of the skin friction, wall heat flux, and boundary-layer mean profiles. The Boussinesq assumption leads to essentially correct predictions of the Reynolds shear stress, but gives wrong predictions of the Reynolds normal stresses. The constant Prandtl number model gives an adequate prediction of the normal turbulent heat flux, while it fails to predict transverse turbulent heat fluxes. The discrepancy in model predictions among the three eddy-viscosity models under investigation is small.},

@article{Zhu2020,
abstract = {To accurately predict the hypersonic turbulent boundary layer, the compressibility corrections for a two-equation turbulence model are investigated substantially. The two-equation shear-stress-transport k-$\omega$ model based on the assumption of an eddy-viscous coefficient is adopted. The closure approximations for pressure work, pressure dilatation, and dilatation dissipation are examined by a priori and a posteriori analyses. The direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a hypersonic boundary layer shows that the pressure work term has little influence on the turbulent energy transport, whereas the effect of pressure expansion and pressure diffusion terms can be counteracted. The individual closure assumptions are evaluated by using the DNS data. Furthermore, Reynolds-averaged Navierâ€“ Stokes simulations with compressibility corrections are conducted for the hypersonic boundary layers of a flat plate and a cone. Comparisons with the experimental data and engineering correlations show that the original turbulence model overestimates the heat flux, and the pressure dilation and dilation dissipation corrections lead to a decrease in heating transfer rates. The combination of a priori and a posteriori analyses comes to the conclusion that the Zeman correction of the dilation dissipation term is applicable in hypersonic boundary layers.},

	abstract = { Direct numerical simulations (DNS) of flat-plate, zero-pressure-gradient turbulent bound- ary layers are presented for nominal freestream Mach numbers of 11 and 14 and a highly cooled wall (wall-to-recovery temperature of approximately 0.2). The flow conditions of the DNS are representative of the experimental data for a Mach 11.1 turbulent boundary layer on a flat plate that was tested at Calspan--University of Buffalo Research Center (CUBRC) and the operational conditions of the AEDC Hypervelocity Tunnel No. 9 at Mach 14. The wall shear stress and turbulent heat flux predicted by DNS show good comparisons with those measured at CUBRC and those modeled with a Baldwin-Lomax model. The generated DNS database extends the range of Reynolds numbers from those typical of previous DNS studies for hypersonic boundary-layer flows and confirms the validity of Morkovin's hypothesis within the relatively broader range of Reynolds numbers considered in this study. A priori assessment of turbulent heat flux models with DNS data shows that the algebraic energy flux (AEF) formulation gives better predictions of the streamwise turbulent heat flux than the commonly used constant turbulent Prandtl number model while both models give similarly good predictions of the wall-normal turbulent heat flux. A posteriori assessment shows that the AEF model improves the prediction of the temperature profiles while keeping a good prediction of the velocity field. },

	abstract = {Aerothermoelastic fluid--structure interaction (FSI) is a crucial problem in the design of supersonic and hypersonic vehicles, but modeling capabilities are in many cases quite limited. Insufficient treatment of FSI can limit design options or lead to damage or loss of vehicles. To improve understanding of such problems, we conducted FSI experiments with thin panels in hypersonic flow in the hypersonic wind tunnel H2K at DLR, Cologne, where both thermal and pressure-driven effects can be observed. Both cases with and without turbulent shock-wave/boundary-layer interaction (SWBLI) were considered. We obtained severe dynamic effects which led to the failure of the thinner panel. The results show a strong dependency of the dynamics of the coupled system on small temperature changes. Furthermore, we demonstrated that a large incident shock angle facilitates flutter in cases where it would not occur without incident shock. Detailed reference experiments regarding aerothermal heating, wall pressure and dynamic properties of the flow field were conducted using a rigid structure. This extends the very limited experimental data base on FSI in hypersonic flow serving as reference for modeling and preparation of new experiments.},
