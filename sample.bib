abstract = "A comparative performance analysis of the CFD platforms OpenFOAM and FLOW-3D is presented, focusing on a 3D swirling turbulent flow: a steady hydraulic jump at low Reynolds number. Turbulence is treated using RANS approach RNG k-ε. A Volume Of Fluid (VOF) method is used to track the air–water interface, consequently aeration is modeled using an Eulerian–Eulerian approach. Structured meshes of cubic elements are used to discretize the channel geometry. The numerical model accuracy is assessed comparing representative hydraulic jump variables (sequent depth ratio, roller length, mean velocity profiles, velocity decay or free surface profile) to experimental data. The model results are also compared to previous studies to broaden the result validation. Both codes reproduced the phenomenon under study concurring with experimental data, although special care must be taken when swirling flows occur. Both models can be used to reproduce the hydraulic performance of energy dissipation structures at low Reynolds numbers."

abstract = "The study of hypersonic flows and their underlying aerothermochemical reactions is particularly important in the design and analysis of vehicles exiting and reentering Earth's atmosphere. Computational physics codes can be employed to simulate these phenomena; however, verification of these codes is necessary to certify their credibility. To date, few approaches have been presented for verifying codes that simulate hypersonic flows, especially flows reacting in thermochemical nonequilibrium. In this paper, we present our code-verification techniques for verifying the spatial accuracy and thermochemical source term in hypersonic reacting flows in thermochemical nonequilibrium. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques on the Sandia Parallel Aerodynamics and Reentry Code (SPARC)."

@article{Kaynak2012,
abstract = {The effect of compressibility on supersonic boundary layer transition is simulated by modifying a standard -Re t correlation-based transition model under two-dimensional (2D) approximation. First, the -Re t model's empirical correlations derived for low Mach numbers are validated against some well-known subsonic flat plate experiments. Second, the same empirical correlations are tested against a direct numerical simulation (DNS) dataset closely approximating a supersonic flat plate experiment at M ¼ 2.25. Finally, the present empirical correlations are extended for supersonic speeds using a known compressibility correlation. For this, the free stream turbulence level is assumed to remain constant and the free stream velocity is increased up to a supersonic speed of Mach 2.7 using adiabatic wall conditions. Numerical results show that the modified -Re t transition model is capable of predicting the downstream movement of the transition onset location in good agreement with the linear theory, experiments, and DNS data up to Mach 2.25. The length of the transition region is observed to grow with higher Mach numbers, and destabilizing effect of compressibility after Mach 2.0 is also predicted, in a limited sense, under the 2D approximation.},

In Part 1 of this paper we focus on: 1. The basics of geometry modeling and analysis-suitable geometry construction for wind turbine rotors; 2. The fluid mechanics formulation and its suitability and accuracy for rotating turbulent flows; 3. The coupling of air flow and a rotating rigid body. In Part 2, we focus on the structural discretization for wind turbine blades and the details of the fluid–structure interaction computational procedures. The methods developed are applied to the simulation of the NREL 5MW offshore baseline wind turbine rotor. The simulations are performed at realistic wind velocity and rotor speed conditions and at full spatial scale. Validation against published data is presented and possibilities of the newly developed computational framework are illustrated on several examples.},

@book{Rumsey2009,
abstract = {The ability of kappa-omega models to predict compressible turbulent skin friction in hypersonic boundary layers is investigated. Although uncorrected two-equation models can agree well with correlations for hot-wall cases, they tend to perform progressively worse - particularly for cold walls - as the Mach number is increased in the hypersonic regime. Simple algebraic models such as Baldwin-Lomax perform better compared to experiments and correlations in these circumstances. Many of the compressibility corrections described in the literature are summarized here. These include corrections that have only a small influence for kappa-omega models, or that apply only in specific circumstances. The most widely-used general corrections were designed for use with jet or mixing-layer free shear flows. A less well-known dilatation-dissipation correction intended for boundary layer flows is also tested, and is shown to agree reasonably well with the Baldwin-Lomax model at cold-wall conditions. It exhibits a less dramatic influence than the free shear type of correction. There is clearly a need for improved understanding and better overall physical modeling for turbulence models applied to hypersonic boundary layer flows.},

abstract = {Abstract The goal of the paper is to bring to the attention of the computational community a long overlooked, very simple, acceleration method that impressively speeds up explicit time-stepping schemes, at essentially no extra cost. The authors explain the basis of the method, namely stabilization via wisely chosen inner steps (stages), justify it for linear problems, and spell out how simple it is to incorporate in any explicit code for parabolic problems. Finally, we demonstrate its performance on the (linear) heat equation as well as on the (non-linear) classical Stefan problem, by comparing it with standard implicit schemes (employing SOR or Newton iterations). The results show that super-time-stepping is more efficient than the implicit schemes in that it runs at least as fast, it is of comparable or better accuracy, and it is, of course, much easier to program (and to parallelize for distributed computing).},

@article{Luis2012,
abstract = {It is well known that openFoam has become a very popular tool for research work in different fields and particularly, in fluid dynamics. But, it is also known its lack of detailed documentation support-ing solvers made using the set of libraries provided by openFoam. Therefore, it becomes necessary to establish appropriate verifications that can be useful to users going for instance, through the selection of equations discretization schemes from fvSchemes libraries and of solution solvers from fvSolutions libraries, to be later applied in the simulation of a given specific problem. With this purpose, executable solvers available in openFoam 1.7 version to solve supersonic air flow problems are tested. Two different approaches have been taken in developing numerical methods to solve problems in transport phenomena at all Mach numbers and traditionally, they have been referred to as pressure-based and density-based methods. In this work, the advantages or disadvantages in applying any one of these methods, are ad-dressed. To accomplish the proposed tasks, 2D and axisymmetric numerical simulations of well posed problems that have either an analytical solution or available experimental data to compare with, are performed.},
